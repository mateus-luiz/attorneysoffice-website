            <h2>Labor Law</h2>

            <article>
                Labor law is legislation specifying responsibilities and rights in employment, particularly the responsibilities of the employer and the rights of the employee. Laws differ among jurisdictions; this definition pertains to labor law within the United States.

                Protection of employee rights begins with fair hiring practices. By law, an employer cannot conduct a background or credit check on an applicant without their written permission. It is also illegal for an employer to discriminate against an applicant because of their age, race, religion or country of origin. According to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), employers cannot discriminate against a prospective employee with any disability unless it renders them incapable of performing tasks related to the position.

            <h2>Consumer Law</h2>

            <article>
                Consumer law involves all of the regulations and statutes that seek to create a more equitable balance for buyers in the marketplace and prevent sellers from using dishonest tactics. A consumer is any individual who purchases goods or services, which may be sold by manufacturers, wholesalers, or retailers.

                Both state and federal laws play a role in regulating consumer law. These laws range from prohibiting false advertising and imposing product safety measures to regulating debt collection practices and protecting consumers identifying information. Consumers often find themselves needing legal help after falling victim to an online scam, purchasing a car or other product without being told of hidden defects, or losing money in financial schemes, such as identity theft or unauthorized credit card charges.
